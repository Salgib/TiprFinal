Cover Letter:


  my name is Shawn and I'm very interested in the junior wordpress developer position listed on your site.
I have recently graduated from the Front End Engineering program at The Iron Yard based in Downtown Greenville. While attending this program I was able to go from very basic level HTML and CSS skills all the way to building fully functional apps using the latest industry frameworks along with plenty of javascript and jquery. Am I an expert wordpress developer? No. However, I am very eager to expand my skillset in development and look forward to speaking with you further.
